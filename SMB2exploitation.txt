# SMB2 Man-in-the-Middle Attack Example

This document provides a step-by-step example of how a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack could potentially exploit an SMB2 connection where message signing is enabled but not required. 

**DISCLAIMER: This example is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized hacking is illegal. Always obtain proper authorization before conducting penetration testing or any kind of vulnerability scanning.**

## Prerequisites

- Two Windows machines on the same network, one acting as the SMB2 server and the other as the client.
- A third machine (the attacker) with network access to both the client and server.
- Network sniffing and spoofing tools, such as Wireshark and ettercap.

## Step 1: Intercepting the Connection

1. On the attacker's machine, start Wireshark to monitor network traffic.
2. Identify the IP addresses of the client and server machines.

## Step 2: Performing the Downgrade Attack

1. Use ettercap to perform an ARP spoofing attack, positioning the attacker's machine between the client and server:

```bash
sudo ettercap -T -M arp:remote /<client-ip>/ /<server-ip>/

    When the client initiates an SMB2 connection with the server, the attacker's machine intercepts the communication.
    Since the server doesn't require SMB2 message signing, the attacker manipulates the communication to tell the client that the server doesn't support message signing.

Step 3: Reading or Modifying Traffic

    With message signing disabled, the attacker can now read the SMB2 traffic between the client and server in Wireshark.
    If the traffic includes sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, the attacker can capture this information.
    The attacker could also potentially modify the traffic, such as changing the contents of files being transferred or inserting malicious code.

Mitigation

To prevent this type of attack, enforce SMB2 message signing on all servers and clients. This ensures that all SMB2 traffic is signed and can't be read or modified by an attacker.

Remember, this is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, there would be additional complexities, such as network firewalls and intrusion detection systems, that could prevent or detect this type of attack.
